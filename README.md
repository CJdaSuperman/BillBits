# BillBits
I've made 4 games so far, and this C# Windows Form application is the project I'm most proud of.

It's a bill organizer where you can organize your bills between your unpaid and paid ones. Create a bill with information such as the due date, its balance, and minimum due. You can then enter in when you paid the bill and how much you paid, then it's organized as a paid bill. Each bill you can edit its information, see how long it will take to pay off based upon how much you pay towards it, and make notes about that bill. 

The reason I'm most proud of this is because it's the first application I made on my own. No tutorials or a coding problem to solve. It came about because I saw how my parents keep track of their bills and I figured I could make something useful for them. It's a full-blown application with all its features made on my own and the feedback on what to add that came from my parents using it. 

To find the source code for this project, BillOrganizer folder has the code for the Forms and in the Classes folder, it has the data classes. I also created a UML class diagram for the project to show how I visualized the scripts behaving with one another.
